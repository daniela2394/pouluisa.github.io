My name is Luisa Pou and I will be obtaining a Bachelor of Fine Arts this June. I have a five year plan that motivates me
to concentrate and finish school. I plan to travel and work abroad and gain more cultural experiences. I have two 
wonderful cats whos act like dogs, and the hardest part about traveling is always leaving them behind.
